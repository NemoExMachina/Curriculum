            <p>
                A computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computare," meaning to calculate. 
                It accepts raw data as input, processes it according to user commands, stores it, and produces meaningful 
                information as output. Generally, a computer works on the IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle and follows 
                the GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle.
            </p>

            <h3>1's Complement</h3>
            <p>
                Reciprocal of 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s is its 1's complement. For example, 1's complement of <strong>(1011)<sub>2</sub></strong> is <strong>(0100)<sub>2</sub></strong>.
            </p>
            <h2>2's Complement</h2>
            <p>
                Adding 1 to the 1's complement of a given binary number is its 2's complement.
                For example, if <strong>(1010)<sub>2</sub></strong> is a given number, then its 1's complement is <strong>(0101)<sub>2</sub></strong> and 2's complement is <strong>(0101)<sub>2</sub> + (1)<sub>2</sub> = (0110)<sub>2</sub></strong>.
            </p>
            <h2><strong>Introduction: Boolean Logic</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Boolean Algebra is algebra of logic, which deals with the study of binary variables and logical operation. As every data are represented in terms  binary values, we need to manipulate those values by using some certain rules and expression which we can do through Boolean algebra. It is most common and basic method to analysis and design logic circuit. It was introduced by an English mathematician George Boole. In Boolean algebra the variables can have only one of the two possible value 0 and1 (False or True). Every modern digital computers understand either this two values.
            </p>
            <strong>Boolean Algebra</strong>
            <p>It is algebra of logic which could accept either of the possible two values 0 and 1 and generate a result through logical relationship and operation.</p>
            <strong>Boolean Variable</strong>
            <p>Those entities which has either or 0 and 1 and denote some specific operation ore known as boolean variable. Simply, it is an entity in Boolean algebra which has only either of the two possible values. This variable are denoted by A, B, P, Q, X, Y, Z….</p>
            <strong>Boolean Function</strong>
            <p>Boolean function is an expression formed by binary variables, binary operators such as AND, OR, NOT, parentheses, and equal sign for a given set of value this boolean function gives the 0 or 1 as a result.</p>
            <h2><strong>Logic Gate</strong></h2>
            <p>
                A logic Gate is an electronic circuit that operates on one or more inputs to produce an output. Logic Gate are used for binary operations which are very fundamental components for modern digital computer. Logic gates are embedded unit an Integrated Circuit (IC). Each gate has its specific function and graphical symbol. In digital computer there are three basic logic gates. Click here for gate symbol and Venn diagram.
            </p>
            <h3>a. AND gate</h3>
            <p>
                AND Gate is an electronic Circuit which produce high output (1) only when both the inputs are high. The output is same as the result of basic arithmetic multiplication. This gate may have more than two inputs and produce a single output. Graphically AND gate is represented as
            </p>
            <p>AND gate is denoted by “ . ” So, output is expressed algebraically as, Y = A</p>

            <p>
                NAND gate is a derived gate, derived from NOT and AND gate. This gate reciprocal the output obtain from the AND gate. That means it will produce low-0 output when both the inputs are high-1 and produce high-1 output when any one of the input is low-0. These gate also may have two or more than two and a single output.

            <div class="content">
                <p>Computer software is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Software is a general term for the various kinds of programs used to operate computers and related devices. Software can be thought of as the variable part of a computer and hardware the invariable part. Software is often divided into application software, or user downloaded programs that fulfill a want or need, and system software, which includes operating systems and any program that supports application software.</p>
                <p>Operating systems are a type of software that controls the computer hardware and acts as an interface with application programs. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system. Without an operating system, a user cannot run an application program on their computer, unless the application program is self booting.</p>
                <p>Operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending output to the display screen, keeping track of files and directories on the disk, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers. For large systems, the operating system has even greater responsibilities and powers. It is like a traffic cop -- it makes sure that different programs and users running at the same time do not interfere with each other. The operating system is also responsible for security, ensuring that unauthorized users do not access the system.</p>
                <p>Operating systems can be classified as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multi-user: Allows two or more users to run programs at the same time. Some operating systems permit hundreds or even thousands of concurrent users.</li>
                    <li>Multiprocessing: Supports running a program on more than one CPU.</li>
                    <li>Multitasking: Allows more than one program to run concurrently.</li>
                    <li>Multithreading: Allows different parts of a single program to run concurrently.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some operating systems permit hundreds or even thousands of concurrent users. Others support only a single user at a time. Operating systems can be classified as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-time: Responds to input instantly. General-purpose operating systems, such as DOS and UNIX, are not real-time.</li>
                    <li>Single-user: Allows one user to run one program at a time. Once the operating system loads and starts, the user has complete control of the system until the...</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>On the basis of User Interface (UI)</h2>
                <p>A user interface allows user to interact with the computer system. It provides user with an ideal environment so that user can experience better computing. It brings structure to the interaction between user and computer. Without user interface it is almost impossible to operate a computer smoothly. Hence, in order to enhance the experience of using computer, UI plays vital role. Mainly there are 2 types of User Interface (UI).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Character User Interface (CUI)</li>
                    <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>1) Character User Interface (CUI)</h3>
                <p>It is a type of operating system in which whole computer operates or depend upon the command issued by user. All the operations that take place in CUI have their own specific command. Hence, they are known as Character User Interface. User have to remember all the command need to operate the computers. So, they are non user friendly. Only the people people having technical knowledge would operate this type of operating system. It is primitive type of OS, in which graphics, pictures, icons, drop-down menu, dialogue box etc are not used which make it more difficult to use. It uses the character or text mode of computer such as DOS and UNIX. A command prompt is a sequence of character used in CUI. Commands are typed in to instruct computer. MS-DOS is a Character User Interface operating system.</p>
                <p>The major advantage of this type of OS is they can have quick response as long as user enters correct command whereas, the disadvantages of command driven User Interface is that, they are very difficult to use if the user is beginner and doesn't know correct command. However, it can be used in older system with no processing capabilities and low storage.</p>
                <h4>Features of CUI</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is single user and single tasking operating system.</li>
                    <li>Less user friendly than GUI.</li>
                    <li>Commands are used to instruct the computer.</li>
                    <li>User needs to remember the command for operating this system.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2) Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>
                <p>It is a type of operating system in which computer are operated just by clicking or selecting the required icon or dialogue box instead of writing a direct command to the system. Since graphics like icons, pictures, drop-down menus, dialogue boxes etc are used which makes it more user-friendly than CUI. Since, user doesn't have to remember a single command, every user without technical knowledge can also use this type of OS. Due to user friendly interface, they are simple to use and widely used for domestic application. The goal of graphical operating system is to create a system that the computer user can turn on and operate in right way without any training or by remembering commands. The main advantages of GUI is that they are easy to use especially for beginners. The main disadvantage of GUI is they consume more memory for operation.Windows, MAC OS etc are the example of GUI.</p>
                <p>The first Graphical User Interface was designed by Xerox corporations Palo's Alto research center in 1970's, but it was not popular whereas in until the 1980's the emergence of Apple Macintosh that use GUI became popular.</p>
                <h4>Features of GUI</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is user-friendly. So, it is easy to use.</li>
                    <li>User don't have to remember supports full multimedia and animation.</li>
                    <li>It requires larger memory for its processing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>GUI environment have following basic components.</p>
                <h4>Icon</h4>
                <p>Icons are the small pictures that represent commands, files or windows.</p>
                <h4>Pointer</h4>
                <p>A symbol (usually angled arrow) that appears on the display screen and that are moved to select objects and commands. They are controlled by a pointing device such as a mouse, track pad, light pens etc.</p>
                <h4>Desktop</h4>
                <p>The area on the display screen where icons are grouped is refereed as desktop.</p>
                <h4>Windows</h4>
                <p>Windows are displayed on screen and we can change their shape and size at will. Each windows can run a different program or display different information.</p>
                <h4>Menus</h4>
                <p>Most graphical user interface let us to execute commands by selecting a choice from a menu.</p>
                <h4>Folders</h4>
                <p>Graphical representation of a directory.</p>

            <h1 class="main-title">Chapter 5: Programming Concepts and Logics</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>As we know every computerized device does not work by itself. They needed to be given some sort of command that makes computer work. These commands help to instruct the computer and program specific action required by the user. Since the commands are given in the form of computer language, we need programming languages to write the set of instructions which command the computer to perform certain actions collectively called programs. These programs are again integrated in order to make a complete software. Simply software is the collection of different interrelated programs which perform specific functions.</p>
                <p>Programs written in any type of programming language are not understood by the computer hence we need some sort of language translator or processor such as assembler, compiler, and interpreter which has the basic function of converting programs written in any type of language into machine-level language.</p>
                <p>The program written by the programmer is known as the source program. After converting it becomes the object program.</p>
                <h3>Qualities of Good Programs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It should be easily understood.</li>
                    <li>A program should be correct; it should be error-free.</li>
                    <li>It should be reliable.</li>
                    <li>It should have an easily understandable user interface.</li>
                    <li>It should be portable and flexible.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Programming Language</h2>
                <p>In order to make communication between user and computer, we need a computer language that helps the user to generate commands to perform as per the requirement. This language with which we can give instructions to the computer is known as a programming language. Programming languages are the set of different keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other entities using different character sets including numbers, special symbols, and alphanumeric values.</p>
                <p>Hence, the process of writing the programming language is known as programming and the person who writes programs is a programmer.</p>
                <h3>Types of Programming Language</h3>
                <p>There are several types of programming languages which can be categorized as follows:</p>
                <h4>1. Low-Level Language</h4>
                <p>Low-level languages are machine-dependent languages which means programs written for one type of system cannot be run on another system. Developers should have detailed analysis and knowledge about the system for which they are going to write a program. Hence, programming in low-level languages is very much difficult and time-consuming. Different types of programming languages are:</p>
                <h5>a. Machine Level Language (1GL)</h5>
                <p>This language consists of a sequence of 0’s and 1’s to generate instructions. Since it uses binary numbers, this type of language is directly understood by the processor. So, it has higher execution speed. It is also a machine-dependent language in which programmers should have detailed knowledge of the system.</p>
                <h6>Advantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is directly understood by the processor so execution speed is relatively high.</li>
                    <li>Language translator or processor is not needed.</li>
                    <li>They can be used to program specific purpose computers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Disadvantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is difficult and time-consuming to develop and debug programs.</li>
                    <li>It is a machine-dependent language. So, programs developed for one system cannot be operated on another system.</li>
                    <li>All the syntax and commands are in the form of binary numbers which are difficult to remember.</li>
                    <li>Programmers should have detailed knowledge about a particular system and its architecture.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>b. Assembly Language (2GL)</h5>
                <p>Assembly languages are also an example of low-level languages. In this language, instead of writing instructions in the series of 0’s and 1’s we can use mnemonics (symbolic instructions) like ADD, SUB, RST, DIV, MOD, and so on. Since it is closer to machine-level language, a programmer should have detailed knowledge about computer internal architecture. This language is faster in comparison to high-level languages. Since this language is not directly understood by the computer, we need a language translator like an assembler to convert it into machine-level language.</p>
                <h6>Advantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is easier to write, debug and understand programming written in assembly-level language compared to machine-level language.</li>
                    <li>Program execution is higher compared to high-level language.</li>
                    <li>Since they are machine-dependent, they are used to develop different device drivers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Disadvantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a machine-dependent language, i.e. programs made for one processor don’t run on another processor.</li>
                    <li>Use of mnemonics code makes assembly language much more complex.</li>
                    <li>Program development and debugging are more difficult and time-consuming compared to high-level language.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2. High-Level Language</h4>
                <p>This language is close to the English language. High-level language code is written in English-like structure using mathematical notation. Since it is similar to the English language, it is easier to develop and debug the program. It is a machine-independent language (i.e. programs developed for one processor can work on another processor). Since HLL (high-level language) is not directly understood by the computers, we need a language processor or translator such as a compiler and interpreter for converting programs written in high-level language to machine-level language. FORTRAN (Formula Translator) introduced in 1956 A.D is the first high-level language. Nowadays there are many high-level languages like C, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.</p>
                <h6>Advantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since it is closer to the English language, programs written in this language are easier to write, debug and understand.</li>
                    <li>Since it is machine-independent, programs written for one processor can work on another processor.</li>
                    <li>Programmers don’t have to remember a large number of mnemonics and other unusual codes.</li>
                    <li>Program development is faster and requires less effort than other languages.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Disadvantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Computers don’t understand high-level language directly. So the program needs conversion before execution.</li>
                    <li>Program execution is slower compared to low-level language.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>a. Procedural Oriented Language (3GL)</h5>
                <p>This type of language is a high-level language that primarily focuses on procedure rather than on data. Hence, they are used to express the logic and the procedure of the program. Since it focuses only on procedure, it is complex and time-consuming to write a large program. This type of language follows a top-to-bottom approach i.e. the main function is written at the bottom of the program. This type of language doesn’t pose important and powerful features like data encapsulation, data inheritance, data extraction, and so on. So, this type of language has less security compared to object-oriented language. Because of their flexibility, procedural languages are able to solve a variety of problems. Examples: C, FORTRAN, QBasic, etc.</p>
                <h6>Advantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Program development and debugging are easier compared to low-level language.</li>
                    <li>More advanced and user-friendly software can be developed.</li>
                    <li>It is also a machine-independent language.</li>
                    <li>It is used as a general-purpose programming language.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Disadvantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Language translator or processor is required to execute the program.</li>
                    <li>Program execution is slower.</li>
                    <li>Data security is less in comparison to other high-level languages.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>b. Problem/Object Oriented Language (4GL)</h5>
                <p>This is the advanced form of high-level language which primarily focuses on data rather than procedure. It allows the user to specify what the output should be without describing all the details (i.e. procedure) of how the data should be manipulated. This type of language follows a bottom-up approach. That means all main functions are written at the bottom of the program whereas classes and objects are described at the top of the program. Since it has several powerful features such as data encapsulation, data extraction, and inheritance, the data are more secure compared to procedural language. Examples: C#, C++, Java, etc.</p>
                <h6>Advantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web-based applications and software can be developed.</li>
                    <li>More advanced and user-friendly software can be developed.</li>
                    <li>It is also a machine-independent language.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Disadvantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Language translator is required to execute the program.</li>
                    <li>Program execution is slower.</li>
                    <li>It is difficult to develop hardware-oriented language.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>c. Natural Language (5GL)</h5>
                <p>Natural language uses simple statements of common communication language where we could write statements that would look like normal sentences. It is still in the developing stage; computer scientists are working hard to develop such language. However, programming languages like PROLOG (programming logic) are currently in use. For example: - instead of writing some unusual code, programmers would write: “who are the salesmen who have sold more than 30,000 products last month?”</p>
                <h6>Advantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>It will be even easier to develop and debug the program.</li>
                    <li>It will also be a machine-independent language.</li>
                    <li>More advanced and user-friendly programs will be made.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Disadvantage:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Language translator is required to execute the program.</li>
                    <li>Program execution is slower.</li>
                    <li>It is difficult to develop hardware-oriented language.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Language Translator/Processor</h2>
                <p>Language translator is that system development software which helps to convert programs written in assembly or high-level language (source program) into machine-level language (object program). Since it is difficult and inconvenient to write a program in machine-level language, language developers use several assemblies and high-level languages which are not directly understood by the computer. Hence, we use different types of language processors to convert and make machine understandable. There are different types of language translators.</p>
                <h3>Assembler</h3>
                <p>These language translators/processors convert programs written in assembly-level language (source program) into machine-understandable language (object language). Since assembly-level languages are closer to machine-level language, the conversion taken by the assembler is relatively less. It converts the program at once into machine-level language.</p>
                <h3>Compiler</h3>
                <p>Those language processors which help to convert programs written in high-level language (source program) into machine-level program (object program). It converts the whole program into machine-level language at once. It is the largest method of translating a program in which debugging is complex and time-consuming. Programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc. use compilers.</p>
                <h3>Interpreter</h3>
                <p>This is the type of language which converts programs written in high-level language (source program) into machine-level language (object program). It converts one statement at a time so its debugging can be easier and less time-consuming. Its program execution is slower than that of a compiler. Most of the new programming languages use interpreters which allocate less memory space. Programs like BASIC, C#, PHP, etc. use interpreters for conversion.</p>
                <h2>Syntax and Semantics</h2>
                <p>As we know programming language helps the user to communicate with the computer. The user is governed by several sets of codes which instruct the computer to perform some specific tasks. This set of codes and its structure is known as syntax. In addition, semantics is the meaning attached to individual words or symbols in programming language. For example:</p>
                <p>In QBasic:</p>
                <pre>Print "This is programming"; P</pre>
                <p>Here, Print is Semantics and the whole line is Structure (syntax).</p>
                <h2>Error (BUG)</h2>
                <p>There may be several errors inside a program which stops the program from being executed. Thus, an error in a program is known as a bug. This type of error in a program may arise by not following proper rules given by the programming language due to poor problem analysis or maybe due to hardware failure. Errors in the program may give ambiguous (not accepted/false) results. The process of removing errors from a computer program is known as debugging. There are three types of errors:</p>
                <h3>Syntax Error</h3>
                <p>The error which may arise due to not following proper rules or format given by the programming language. Every programming language has its own vocabulary, punctuation, and structure. Programmers need to follow every detail while programming. This type of error can be detected by language processors such as compilers and interpreters. For example, in C, every statement should end with a semi-colon at the end of the statement then the errors encountered are syntax errors.</p>
                <h3>Logical Error</h3>
                <p>Logic refers to the idea or concept used to solve a specific problem. If the problem is poorly understood then it may hamper while solving the problem. The error that is encountered due to poorly developed logic is called a logical error. This type of error is not detected by the language processor. For example, in order to calculate simple interest, we use the formula I = (P*T*R)/100, if we write the above-mentioned formula as I = P*T*R, then the error encountered is a logical error.</p>
                <h3>Runtime Error</h3>
                <p>When a program is running or executing, it is said to be runtime. Hence, the errors that are encountered/found while the program is being executed are known as runtime errors. It is also not detected by the language translator. For example, if there is insufficient memory space, or a peripheral device is not turning on.</p>
                <h2>Some Common Terminology in Programming</h2>
                <h3>Data Types</h3>
                <p>It specifies the type of data to be used in a program. There are several data types such as integer, float, character, string, etc.</p>
                <h3>Variable</h3>
                <p>It is a memory location where data is stored. It is used to store data temporarily. It is also known as a container which holds data.</p>
                <h3>Constant</h3>
                <p>It is a fixed value which cannot be changed during the execution of the program. It is also known as a literal.</p>
                <h3>Operator</h3>   
                <p>It is a symbol that performs some specific operation on one or more operands. For example, +, -, *, /, %, etc.</p>
                <h3>Loop</h3>
                <p>It is a control structure that repeats a block of code until a certain condition is met. There are three types of loops: for, while, and do-while.</p>
                <h3>Array</h3>
                <p>It is a collection of similar data types stored in contiguous memory locations. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable.</p>
                <h3>Function</h3>
                <p>It is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is used to break the program into smaller modules which makes the program easier to understand and debug.</p>
                <h3>String handling functions</h3>
                <p>It is a set of functions that are used to manipulate strings. For example, strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(), etc.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.</p>
                <h2>Common Terms Related to Internet</h2>
                <h3>ISP</h3>
                <p>ISP (Internet Service Provider) is an institution that provides access to the Internet in some form, usually for money. Mercantile, Everest net, World link, etc. are some ISP in Nepal.</p>
                <h3>Link</h3>
                <p>Links are quick route (way) to jump the other web pages from your current page. This is one of the ways to navigate the Internet. Links are usually printed in different colour than the rest of the text around it.</p>
                <h3>Search Engine</h3>
                <p>Search engines are the software that searches the web sites for you. Yahoo, Excite, Lycos, Alta Vista, etc. are some examples.</p>
                <h3>Domain Name and IP (Internet Protocol) Address</h3>
                <p>The unique name that identifies an Internet site. Domain names always have 2 or more parts, separated by dots. The part on the left is the most specific, and the part on the right is the most general. IP (Internet Protocol) address is the corresponding number of domain name, which creates the logical connections between different computers using different domain name and transfer data from one computer to another.</p>
                <h3>DNS Server</h3>
                <p>DNS (Domain Name Services) Server is an Internet-wide structure unique alphanumeric name for computer hosts agents TCP/IP numeric host address. Eg. Internet.net</p>
                <h3>Web Server</h3>
                <p>Web server is a site on which the WebPages are kept. It is a program that responds to requests from web browsers to relative resources.</p>
                <h3>Usernet Newsgroups or Net News</h3>
                <p>These are special headlines through which you can search the related topics easily. Eg. You can type Sci for science, Rec for recreation, etc. While you type these letters in Search box, you will get related information about science or recreation.</p>
                <h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
                <p>Mailing lists are special type of e-mail list, which are delivered via email to the individual mailboxes (email recipients) that subscribe to the list.</p>
                <h3>POP Server</h3>
                <p>This is the server where your incoming mails are stored in your mailbox for you to collect it from. Post Office Protocol (POP) is designed to allow single-user hosts to read mail from a server. It means only that particular person can read that mail that knows the username and password to enter his site.</p>
                <h3>SMTP Server</h3>
                <p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transfer electronic mail between computers. It is a server-to-server protocol, so other protocols are used to access the messages. It accepts incoming mails from other Internet Hosts and drops incoming mail to your mailbox.</p>
                <h3>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h3>
                <p>FTP is one of the protocols. Protocols are set of rules that the computers in the network must follow to communicate and to exchange data with each other. They are used to make logical connection between different computers and transfer data from one computer to another. TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, POP are also some protocols.</p>
                <h3>Anonymous FTP</h3>
                <p>The word 'Anonymous' refers to the things, which are not made public or kept on hidden or unknown. So, Anonymous FTP is a facility to retrieve (open and use) archived sites which contain software, documents of various sorts, files for configuring networks, graphic images, song, lyrics, etc.</p>
                <h3>Archived Files</h3>
                <p>It is a collection of various files, which are not made public.</p>
                <h3>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h3>
                <p>This is one of the protocols that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. When a web browser requests an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document from a web server, the connection is open, the document is transferred and the connection is closed with HTTP protocol.</p>
                <h3>Proxy Server</h3>
                <p>It is a server to improve the access speed of particular pointed browser. It also updates and sometime asks to update the information on your site, itself.</p>
                <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which are used to create web pages that are used in internet to exchange data and information. HTML file itself is a text file which contains several tags and attributes. HTML was developed by Tim Berner Lee that was based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The tags and attributes used to create HTML file are displayed using web browser. Web browser helps to understand all the tags and attributes given by the user and generate the content of the page. The different versions of HTML are: HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML2.0, HTML3.2, HTML 4.01 and now HTML 5.0.</p>
                <h3>Use of HTML</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is used to create a basic layout or design of web page.</li>
                    <li>Without HTML worldwide web wouldn't exist.</li>
                    <li>It allows features like embedding images, videos, audio etc.</li>
                    <li>It allows user to customize and format characters such as bold, italic, underline etc.</li>
                    <li>It helps to create link and list.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Advantages of HTML</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is easy to use, flexible and user friendly.</li>
                    <li>It can be supported by all the web browser and operating system such as Macintosh, windows, unix etc.</li>
                    <li>It is easier to obtain and modify any of the content.</li>
                    <li>It is compatible with all the search engine.</li>
                    <li>There are several new and advance features in HTML 5.0.</li>
                    <li>HTML file takes short period of time to load.</li>
                    <li>Several tutorial can be easily accessed regarding HTML.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Disadvantages of HTML</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is difficult to create attractive and interactive webpages only using HTML. [php, javascript, sql etc]</li>
                    <li>It cannot be used to create dynamic webpages.</li>
                    <li>It is only a scripting language and cannot be used as programming language.</li>
                    <li>There are many incompatibilities of HTML.</li>
                    <li>There is no any complete acceptable standard of HTML.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tags</h3>
                <p>HTML tag are the instructions or command given to the web browser in order to organize text image and any other components of web pages. This HTML tags are executed by web browser respectively. Like any programming language this HTML tags also helps to perform some specific actions. HTML tags are written inside angular brackets &lt;&gt;. There are two types of HTML tag.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> HTML tags and attributes are not case sensitive.</p>
                <h4>Pair tag</h4>
                <p>Those tags which have both opening and closing tags are known as pair tag. They are also known as container tags. If a tag is written only within the angular brackets &lt;&gt; then it is known as opening tag. Whereas, same tag is written within a angular bracket preceded by slash / then it is known as closing tag.</p>
                <h4>Singular tag</h4>
                <p>Those tag which have only opening tag but no closing tag are known as singular tag. They are also known as empty tag.</p>
                <h3>Attributes</h3>
                <p>They are the descriptive properties of a HTML tags written within respective tag. Attributes helps to add some extra feature, which allows designer to customize and modify several components of webpages according to requirement.</p>
                <p>Eg, If &lt;body&gt; is the tag then its attributes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>bgcolor = It helps to add background color.</li>
                    <li>text = It helps to change the color of the text written in webpages.</li>
                    <li>background = It helps to add image in background of webpages.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps to write and execute HTML document</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write all the HTML tags, attributes and related information in a notepad.</li>
                    <li>Save your document by using desired name followed by .HTML extension. Eg, sample.html</li>
                    <li>Execute the html file by using any web browser.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Some common terminologies of web designing</h3>
                <h4>Webpage</h4>
                <p>It is generally a HTML document or written in any other scripting language that help to execute information in the form of text, image, or any other component through internet is called webpage.</p>
                <h4>Website</h4>
                <p>The collection of interrelated webpages is known as website. It may contain any piece of information or may have information that are interrelated with several webpages that are connected through hyperlink. All website has two part:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Domain name: The name use to access website.</li>
                    <li>Web server: It is a storage location where every piece of information associated with website are stored.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Home page</h4>
                <p>The introductory page which is executed at first when we access the website.</p>
                <h4>Web browser</h4>
                <p>It is an application program which help to access any content of webpages that may be in any form using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). This protocol helps to make communication between web browser and web server. For eg, Google chrome, Internet explorer (Microsoft Edge), Safari, Mozilla firefox, Netscape navigator etc.</p>
                <h4>URL</h4>
                <p>It stands for Uniform Research Locator. It is a standard way of referencing a protocol, host and a directory. For eg https://google.com</p>

                <p>The word 'Anonymous' refers to the things, which are not made public or kept on hidden or unknown. So, Anonymous FTP is a facility to retrieve (open and use) archived sites which contain software, documents of various sorts, files for configuring networks, graphic images, song, lyrics, etc.</p>
                <h3>Archived Files</h3>
                <p>It is a collection of various files, which are not made public.</p>
                <h3>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h3>
                <p>This is one of the protocols that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. When a web browser requests an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document from a web server, the connection is open, the document is transferred and the connection is closed with HTTP protocol.</p>
                <h3>Proxy Server</h3>
                <p>It is a server to improve the access speed of particular pointed browser. It also updates and sometime asks to update the information on your site, itself.</p>
                <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which are used to create web pages that are used in internet to exchange data and information. HTML file itself is a text file which contains several tags and attributes. HTML was developed by Tim Berner Lee that was based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The tags and attributes used to create HTML file are displayed using web browser. Web browser helps to understand all the tags and attributes given by the user and generate the content of the page. The different versions of HTML are: HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML2.0, HTML3.2, HTML 4.01 and now HTML 5.0.</p>

                    <li>Several tutorial can be easily accessed regarding HTML.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Disadvantages of HTML</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is difficult to create attractive and interactive webpages only using HTML. [php, javascript, sql etc]</li>
                    <li>It cannot be used to create dynamic webpages.</li>
                    <li>It is only a scripting language and cannot be used as programming language.</li>
                    <li>There are many incompatibilities of HTML.</li>
                    <li>There is no any complete acceptable standard of HTML.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tags</h3>
                <p>HTML tag are the instructions or command given to the web browser in order to organize text image and any other components of web pages. This HTML tags are executed by web browser respectively. Like any programming language this HTML tags also helps to perform some specific actions. HTML tags are written inside angular brackets &lt;&gt;. There are two types of HTML tag.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> HTML tags and attributes are not case sensitive.</p>
                <h4>Pair tag</h4>
                <p>Those tags which have both opening and closing tags are known as pair tag. They are also known as container tags. If a tag is written only within the angular brackets &lt;&gt; then it is known as opening tag. Whereas, same tag is written within a angular bracket preceded by slash / then it is known as closing tag.</p>
                <h4>Singular tag</h4>
                <p>Those tag which have only opening tag but no closing tag are known as singular tag. They are also known as empty tag.</p>
                <h3>Attributes</h3>
                <p>They are the descriptive properties of a HTML tags written within respective tag. Attributes helps to add some extra feature, which allows designer to customize and modify several components of webpages according to requirement.</p>
                <p>Eg, If &lt;body&gt; is the tag then its attributes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>bgcolor = It helps to add background color.</li>
                    <li>text = It helps to change the color of the text written in webpages.</li>
                    <li>background = It helps to add image in background of webpages.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps to write and execute HTML document</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write all the HTML tags, attributes and related information in a notepad.</li>
                    <li>Save your document by using desired name followed by .HTML extension. Eg, sample.html</li>
                    <li>Execute the html file by using any web browser.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Some common terminologies of web designing</h3>
                <h4>Webpage</h4>
                <p>It is generally a HTML document or written in any other scripting language that help to execute information in the form of text, image, or any other component through internet is called webpage.</p>
                <h4>Website</h4>
                <p>The collection of interrelated webpages is known as website. It may contain any piece of information or may have information that are interrelated with several webpages that are connected through hyperlink. All website has two part:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Domain name: The name use to access website.</li>
                    <li>Web server: It is a storage location where every piece of information associated with website are stored.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Home page</h4>
                <p>The introductory page which is executed at first when we access the website.</p>
                <h4>Web browser</h4>
                <p>It is an application program which help to access any content of webpages that may be in any form using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Information Technology</h2>
                <p>Information Technology is a modern concept or methodology of communication. It is the combined form of Information and Communication Technology, which is highly used for the information flow and in many other fields. IT has made the world closer day by day. One can easily send and receive the message throughout the world within a second. It has been widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, etc. It is being used as a learning and teaching tool in the sector of education. Distant learning has become possible due to the advancement of IT. It has been highly used in the industries to control the quantity and quality of the product. It is equally used for the management in hospitals and for the treatment of the patients. IT is being used in the sector of animation and other entertainment. Scientists can use computers or IT for their research and experiment. Space technology has become possible due to IT. Thus it has had such a positive impact on society. But it has some negative impacts, too. As the use of IT is increasing day by day, cyber crimes are also increasing. Cyber criminals can easily steal others’ information or data, they can disclose other secrecy, and they can easily spread the virus in the network and disturb social peace and security.</p>
                <h2>Information Security</h2>
                <p>As we know, in a network or cyber space there is always a threat of cyber attacks which may lead to loss and damages of our precious data and information. It is always necessary to be aware of such malicious activity. We need to adopt different measures while using computers from such intentional and accidental activities. Thus, information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any malfunction. We can use several physical and software preventive measures to protect ourselves from such unethical activities. Information security helps to create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs.</p>
                <p>Information security can mitigate security threats and security attacks. Security threats are possible dangers that might cause unwanted activities in our computer system to breach security and thus cause possible harm whereas a security attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal or alter others' valuable data and information. These attacks can be triggered by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horse, WORMS, etc.</p>
                <p>Information security is built around three major objectives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> It means information is available for only the authorized individual, that means individual or any other system cannot use or process others' information without proper authorization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> It indicates the accuracy and completeness of data and information which means without proper authorization data and information cannot be tampered with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It means information must be always available as per the requirement of the user. It generally refers to accessing our valuable data and information whenever required within no time.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Cryptography</h2>
                <p>The cryptography is derived from the Greek word which means “Secret writing”. Cryptography is the art and science of hiding information. It provides security for information. It is used for providing secure communication between individuals, government agencies, and military forces. Cryptography mostly refers to Encryption and Decryption. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext that is a message to an unreadable format. So that anyone who tries to see the message cannot read the original message. The plain text is converted into unreadable text using special algorithms and keys. The unreadable text is called cipher text. These cipher texts are again converted into readable form through the process of decryption. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. Sometimes, encryption is also termed as encoding or encipher and its reverse process i.e. decryption is also termed as decoding or decipher.</p>
                <h2>Digital Divide</h2>
                <p>Digital Divide is the term used for the gap between the computer literate and illiterate people. Or it can be said that it is a division between technical and non-technical man powers in the field. IT is modern technology and for the use of this technology, one can have sound knowledge of computers. But still, there are a great number of people, who do not know the computers’ operations. They do not understand the computer-related terms. This difference or gap is called digital divide. First, this term came into practice in the mid of 1990s by political speeches and news media. This division is increasing day by day between urban area people and rural area people, educated and uneducated, rich and poor, and so on. So it has become a global issue and governments are trying to bridge this gap.</p>
                <h2>Computer Ethics</h2>
                <p>The computer ethics or the cyber ethics are the set of moral principles or the codes of conduct, which should be strictly followed by computer professionals. The intention of the computer or cyber ethics is to avoid criminal activities through the use of computers. The following are some examples of computer ethics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not use other’s password</li>
                    <li>Do not steal other’s information</li>
                    <li>Do not use computers to harm others</li>
                    <li>Do not disclose other’s secrecy</li>
                    <li>Do not spread virus in the network</li>
                    <li>Do not copy licensed software, which you have not paid</li>
                    <li>Do not alter other’s data</li>
                    <li>Do not take possession of other people’s intellectual property</li>
                    <li>Do not misuse electronic transactions</li>
                    <li>Do not use computer to bear false witness, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Cyber Crime</h2>
                <p>The act of misusing computers, Internet, or other electronic media is called cyber crime. As the use of Information Technology is increasing, the act of cyber crime is also increasing day by day. The following are some examples of cyber crime:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Misuse of computers</li>
                    <li>Spreading virus</li>
                    <li>Stealing other’s information</li>
                    <li>Pirating licensed software</li>
                    <li>Disclosing of other’s secrecy</li>
                    <li>Misuse of electronic transactions and electronic media</li>
                    <li>Rude and vulgar comments on the Internet on racial, communal, and others</li>
                    <li>Alteration of other data without permission</li>
                    <li>Spying others’ information</li>
                    <li>Cracking or hacking</li>
                    <li>Password guessing</li>
                    <li>Salami saving and data diddling</li>
                    <li>Forgery</li>
                    <li>DOS attack, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Cyber Law</h2>
                <p>The law regarding the use of computers is called Cyber Law. It highly concerns the misuse of computers, the Internet, and other electronic media, which are specially used for information flow. Cyber ethics just suggest not committing computer crimes or cyber crimes but the cyber law strictly defines the punishment in case of violation of the laws or cyber principles. Actually, the cyber law is in practice to support the cyber ethics. Nepal Government also has issued the Cyber Law on 11th Falgun, 2061 (18th March 2005) as “The Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005”.</p>
                <p>It has the following provisions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electronic and Digital Signature Law</li>
                    <li>Intellectual Property Law
                        <ul>
                            <li>Copyright Law</li>
